👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Madhukar, an IoT developer and technology enthusiast focused on building practical, real-world IoT solutions.

I primarily work with ESP32-based embedded systems, sensors, and edge devices. I am actively exploring Edge AI using Edge Impulse, along with Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for resource-constrained environments.

I also work with cloud IoT platforms to connect devices, manage data, and enable real-time monitoring and automation.

My approach is simple:
understand the problem deeply, design reliable systems, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
